# MEng Biomedical Engineering Final Year Project

## Modelling the Motility and Proliferative Dynamics of Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) in the Bone Marrow


## Abstract

## Code Directory
Note: The .avi files are movie files and will have to be downloaded for accessibility.

1. main folder
* main.m contains the final code used to obtain the results of this project. <br />
* compare_N.m is a function file that is used in main.m to calculate cell density in a grid.

2. supplementary_videos folder
* video1.avi - simulation of pure motile AML cells
* video2.avi - simulation of pure immotile AML cells

3. miscellaneous folder
* randomwalk_ver3.m contains the code used to obtain the Preliminary Results in the Planning Report and it was the work done in Autumn 2021.
* randomwalk2.avi - simulation of asymmetric division of HSPCs
