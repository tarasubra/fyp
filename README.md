## Modelling the Motility and Proliferative Dynamics of Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) in the Bone Marrow


## Abstract
Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) is the most common type of acute leukaemia in adults and its incidence increases with advancing age. Despite the advancement in stem cell biology and large, comprehensive genomic analyses that have greatly improved the understanding by which AML develops, prognosis remains poor. The invasive behaviour of malignant cells has long been associated with cellular motility. Induction chemotherapy and the cell adhesion through intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and junctional cadherins are two factors that have been shown to reduce AML cell motility. A recent discovery of the existence of an explorative and a non-explorative type of AML cell with different motile behaviour has enabled the quantification of population motility by varying the fraction of explorative cells in population. The impact of the systematic reduction in population motility on proliferation and migratory dynamics have not been well-characterised. Through mathematical modelling, computer simulations and statistical analyses, it was shown that there was a strong positive linear correlation between the growth/spread of AML and population motility while AML growth decreased significantly, and distribution of cells was relatively sparse when the strength of intercellular interactions was increased. Furthermore, it was also proposed that the Baranyi model may better characterise the growth of AML cells which could be the key to understanding the early stages of disease development. Upon experimental validation, the novel insights gained from this study offer new therapeutic opportunities to complement current treatment, potentially improving the outcomes for AML patients.
